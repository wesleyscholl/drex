### 2026-03-08 | exp_7_9 | SUPPORTED (marginally)
**Interpretability Baseline**

The gate is non-random before training (std=0.146). A single linear projection
establishes token-type preferences from embedding geometry alone. Numeric tokens
are the most written (+0.076 trained correlation). Punctuation is avoided (−0.047).
Position has near-zero signal.

**Surprising:** Training barely changed the correlations (0.055 → 0.059 interpretability
score). The preferences are established in the embedding geometry, not learned from
the task. This means a single linear gate's "intelligence" lives in the embedding
space, not the gate weights.

**Changes:** As controllers get more complex, check whether the added layers are
learning task-specific signals or just amplifying embedding biases. The baseline
is now established.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_7_1 | SUPPORTED (strongly)
**Differentiability: STE vs Gumbel vs REINFORCE**

Ranking: Gumbel > STE > REINFORCE on both accuracy and stability.
REINFORCE loss variance: 2.696 (380× worse than Gumbel 0.007).
REINFORCE encoder gradient norm: 0.000 — the encoder does not learn.

**Surprising:** REINFORCE's gradient norm is literally zero. The policy gradient
signal does not flow back to the encoder at all in this setup. REINFORCE trains the
policy over a static, randomly-initialized feature space. This isn't a subtle
degradation — it's a complete training failure for the encoder component.

**Changes:** REINFORCE is ruled out for encoder-memory joint training. Gumbel-softmax
with temperature annealing is the default training mechanism going forward. This
constrains the design space substantially.

*Note: original implementation had a shape bug in the REINFORCE log_prob computation.
Fixed and re-run. See commit history.*

### 2026-03-08 | exp_6_6 | INCONCLUSIVE
**Controller Catastrophic Forgetting**

Domain A accuracy fell from 22.7% to 1.9% after domain B training (−0.208).
EWC reduced this by only 1.8% — negligible protection.

**Surprising:** The EWC failure isn't surprising given the low baseline (22.7%).
EWC protects weights with high Fisher information on domain A, but if those weights
were themselves weakly trained, there is little to protect. The forgetting may be
real but is hard to interpret at this performance level.

**Changes:** Re-run with domain A baseline above 70% before introducing domain B.
The forgetting phenomenon needs a stronger signal to work from. Also: investigate
whether the controller's policy (not just its output layer) is what's being forgotten.
The policy could be forgotten even when the task performance metric stays constant.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_5_1 | REFUTED
**Read Gate Collapse Detection**

Regime A (task only) stabilized at 15.6% read rate — no collapse.
Regime B (sparsity regularizer) collapsed to 9.4% (never).
Regime D (confidence) stable at 65.6%.

**Surprising:** Same pattern as exp_3_2. The regime designed to prevent collapse
(sparsity) caused the opposite collapse. The unconstrained gate found a stable
~16% read rate naturally. Regime A and regime C (coverage penalty) settled at
identical rates (15.6%), suggesting the task loss already determines the equilibrium
and additional regularization provides no marginal benefit.

**Changes:** The "collapse prevention" problem is not the main challenge. The
challenge is designing tasks that require selective memory use so the equilibrium
rate reflects genuine capability, not just distributional convenience.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_4_9 | SUPPORTED (strongly)
**Compositional Retrieval**

Single-hop: 0.968. Two-hop: 1.000. Two-hop *outperforms* single-hop.
The gap is −0.032 in favor of two-hop — the opposite of the expected direction.

**Surprising:** The two-hop architecture is more accurate than single-hop on this
task. The intermediate aggregation step may be acting as a regularizer that prevents
overfitting to spurious correlations in the direct pattern-match. The model is
forced to form a meaningful intermediate representation.

**Changes:** Follow up on why two-hop generalizes better. Is it the architecture or
the task structure? Run this on a larger KB with interference to see if the advantage
holds.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_4_7 | SUPPORTED* (degenerate)
**Null Retrieval Learning**

Null precision: 1.000. Null recall: 0.800. Retrieval on matches: 0.000.
The gate learned to never fire. "Always null" achieves 80% accuracy when 80% of
queries are null.

**Surprising:** The shortcut is perfectly rational. The model correctly learned the
task distribution and found the highest-reward policy — which happens to be useless.
The hypothesis was technically supported but the experiment was gamed.

**Changes:** Redesign with 50/50 null/retrieval split, and separate loss terms for
missed retrievals vs false retrievals. The degenerate solution reveals a task design
flaw, not a controller capability.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_3_2 | REFUTED
**Write Gate Collapse Detection**

Regime A (no signal): stable at 19.3% — no collapse.
Regime D (anti-collapse penalty): collapsed to 95.1% ALWAYS-write.

**Surprising:** The anti-collapse penalty caused the opposite collapse. The
unconstrained gate found a stable natural equilibrium. The assumption that gates
collapse without explicit anti-collapse signal was wrong, at this scale.

**Changes:** Don't add gate regularizers before understanding the natural equilibrium.
Investigate why the unconstrained gate settles at ~20% — is this a property of the
task or the model size?

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_2_9 | REFUTED
**Retrieval vs Storage Compression Objectives**

Both compressors: acc@1 = 1.000. Reconstruction slightly better for A (0.414 vs 0.397).

**Surprising:** The task didn't discriminate between objectives. 5% query noise was
too easy for 8x compression to fail on. Both objectives trained perfectly adequate
retrievers.

**Changes:** Re-run at 64x compression where the ratio curve showed real degradation.
The objective discrimination likely only manifests when compression is severe enough
to require genuine tradeoffs.

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_2_1 | INCONCLUSIVE
**Compression Ratio Curve**

The curve is non-monotonic. 2x–8x: cosine sim ~0.052 (near zero).
16x: cosine sim 0.219 (peak — more compression is better).
Gradual decline from 16x to 100x. No catastrophic cliff.

**Surprising:** Low compression ratios train poorly. Large bottlenecks give the
autoencoder enough room to be lazy — high-capacity models with insufficient training
budget fail to learn. The 16x sweet spot shows that moderate bottleneck constraints
act as useful regularization.

**Changes:** The question is not "where does quality cliff?" but "why does
underconstrained compression fail to learn?" Investigate the training dynamics at
2x–8x: are the gradients too sparse or too small? Does more training or a lower LR
fix the low-compression regime?

---

### 2026-03-08 | exp_1_5 | SUPPORTED (weakly)
**Write Signal Ablation**

Ranking: learned (0.124) > attention (0.121) > random (0.120) > surprise (0.118).
All policies clustered between 11.8–12.4%. Delta of +0.003 for learned.

**Surprising:** Surprise-weighted writing is the worst policy. High perplexity
tokens — the ones with the most "information" by many definitions — are not the
ones most worth remembering for downstream retrieval. The surprise signal is
anticorrelated with retrieval value.

**Changes:** Investigate the surprise anti-correlation further. Does this hold across
task types? If surprise is reliably anti-predictive of retrieval value, it could be
used as a *negative* signal — write the low-surprise, predictable tokens that form
the stable context. This inverts a common assumption.

---

## Meta-Observations (across all phase 1 experiments)

**The natural equilibrium:** Both write and read gates settle at ~15–20% activity
rates when trained on task loss alone. This wasn't predicted and deserves focused
investigation. Is ~16% the right rate for these tasks, or is it a model-size artifact?

**Regularizers are counterproductive:** Anti-collapse penalties, sparsity regularizers,
and coverage bonuses all produced worse behavior than no regularization in these
experiments. The correct approach may be task design rather than loss engineering.

**REINFORCE is ruled out:** Zero gradient norm through the encoder. This narrows
the differentiability design space to Gumbel-softmax and STE. Gumbel is preferred.

**Degenerate solutions dominate:** When a shortcut exists, the model finds it.
Task design is the primary tool for obtaining meaningful results, not loss design.

---

## Meta-Observations (Phase 8)

**Date:** 2026-03-10

Phase 8 completed 29 experiments across categories 41-44 and produced a clear
integration failure signal.

**What held up:**
- EMA smoothing reliably reduces gradient variance (about 75% reduction).
- Global alpha is sufficient; per-position alpha did not add measurable value.
- The episodic/semantic split advantage persists at SEQ_LEN=96.
- Write-gate multi-stability is real, with multiple threshold equilibria.

**What failed critically:**
- The full combination (EMA + split + write gate) collapsed accuracy from
  approximately 0.27 to approximately 0.03.
- Three stabilization attempts all failed: lower gate LR, write-rate regularization,
  and two-phase training.

**Interpretation:**
The write gate appears to interact destructively with EMA+split, likely by pushing
write behavior into pathological regimes that starve useful memory updates.

**Next direction (Phase 9):**
Treat gate interaction failure as the primary blocker. Instrument write-rate
trajectories and gate logits under composition first, then redesign gating under
explicit anti-starvation constraints before further mechanism integration.

---

## Phase 9 — Gate-Writing Interaction Repair (Category 45)
*2026-03-10*

### Root Cause Confirmed

The Phase 8 interpretation was incorrect. The gate did not "interact destructively with
EMA+split" — the gate was broken in complete isolation. The exp_44_1 energy formula
`Delta.pow(2).mean([1,2])` produces values ~0.007-0.016 (O(1/H)) due to averaging over
H² = 4096 matrix elements. With threshold=0.4, the gate fires 0% of the time, write_rate
→ 0, and performance degrades to near-random (~0.03). This was confirmed by exp_45_1
across all 3 seeds: matrix_max_ever < 0.01, vecnorm_mean ≈ 5–8 (O(‖k‖)).

### Phase 9 Results Summary (18 runs, 6 experiments × 3 seeds)

| Exp    | Outcome     | Key finding |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 45_1   | SUPPORTED   | Matrix-mean energy maxes at 0.007–0.009; vector-norm at 5–8. Scale bug confirmed. |
| 45_2   | SUPPORTED   | Relative-norm gate restores acc_gate 0.03→0.22–0.23. acc_full/acc_ema_split = 0.99–1.01. |
| 45_3   | INCONCLUSIVE| rel_norm stays in [0.39–0.40] across dims; matrix_mean dead. abs_norm didn't spread (0.001). |
| 45_4   | REFUTED     | EMA+gate configs have wr=0.96–0.97 (above 0.80 threshold). Gate, split_gate: wr≈0.40. |
| 45_5   | SUPPORTED   | Corrected full system: acc_full/acc_ema_split = 0.99–1.07 across all seeds. |
| 45_6   | REFUTED     | wr at L=32 is 0.95 (above 0.85); wr at L=96 is 0.31. Accuracy comparable, not strictly ≥. |

### Key Learnings

**The fix works**: The relative vector-norm gate (‖k−vp‖ ≥ 0.4×‖k‖) fully restores
accuracy. acc_gate jumps from 0.03 → 0.22–0.23; full system matches EMA+split within 1%.

**Unexpected finding — EMA increases write rate**: EMA+gate configs have wr≈0.96, while
gate-only has wr≈0.40. The EMA slows memory convergence, keeping ‖k−vp‖ large, which
means the gate rarely blocks. This is an emergent interaction between EMA persistence and
the gate threshold.

**Seq-len dependence**: Short sequences (L=32) have high gate fire rates (~0.96) because
the memory hasn't been populated yet (vp≈0, so ‖k−vp‖≈‖k‖ > 0.4×‖k‖ always). Longer
sequences (L=96) have moderate fire rates (~0.31) because the memory builds up. The gate
is sequence-length-sensitive in a predictable way.

**abs_norm spread didn't materialize**: The absolute-norm criterion (fixed threshold=0.4)
produces nearly identical write rates across H∈{32,64,128} because ‖k−vp‖ grows
approximately as √H while the threshold stays fixed — but in practice these nearly cancel.
The relative-norm criterion is stable across dims at wr≈0.40 (gate, split_gate).

### Phase 10 Direction

The gate repair is validated. The key open question is whether the EMA + gate interaction
(wr=0.96 for EMA+gate configs) is benign or whether it effectively neutralizes the gate.
Next priorities:
1. Investigate whether wr=0.96 for EMA+gate is functionally different from no gate at all
2. Explore adaptive/learned gate thresholds that account for EMA persistence
3. Consider sequence-position-dependent thresholds for short vs. long sequence regimes

## Phase 10 — EMA-Gate Threshold Calibration (Category 46)
*2026-03-11*

### Phase 10 Results Summary (18 runs, 6 experiments × 3 seeds)

| Exp    | Outcome      | Key finding |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 46_1   | SUPPORTED    | thresh*=0.70 is the best universal candidate; wr_L32≈0.61, wr_L96≈0.20 (2/3 seeds). |
| 46_2   | REFUTED      | Velocity gate deadlock: M=0 init → vp=0 → velocity=0 → wr=0.000, 3/3 seeds. |
| 46_3   | REFUTED      | Position schedule achieves wr targets at L=32 (thresh_max=1.5/2.0) but accuracy collapses to ~0.03. |
| 46_4   | INCONCLUSIVE | wr_L96 healthy (≈0.198–0.200) but gate gain at L=32 ≤ 0.005 (thresh* insufficient at standard density). |
| 46_5   | REFUTED      | Gate advantage non-monotone with ρ; negative at ρ=0.12 in 2/3 seeds. No capacity-pressure scaling. |
| 46_6   | REFUTED      | wr_L32≈0.81 (bootstrap problem persists); gain_L96 ratio=0.875–0.983 (< 1.02 target). |

### Key Learnings

**thresh*=0.70 is the best candidate, but only marginally**: exp_46_1 found thresh*=0.70
achieves write-rate targets at both lengths (wr_L32≈0.61, wr_L96≈0.20) in 2/3 seeds.
Seed 42 remained INCONCLUSIVE — no single threshold simultaneously satisfied both length
targets with accuracy ≥0.97×EMA. The threshold calibration problem is real but barely
solvable at the standard task density.

**Velocity gate is broken by design**: exp_46_2 revealed a fatal structural flaw:
the memory matrix M initialises to zeros, so vp = M @ k_norm = 0, making velocity
‖vp_t − vp_{t-1}‖/‖k‖ = 0 for the first step and essentially throughout a short sequence.
The gate never fires (wr=0.000) across all 8 configs and all 3 seeds. This is not a
hyperparameter issue — the zero-init deadlock is intrinsic to the design.

**Position schedule trades accuracy for write-rate control**: exp_46_3 revealed a
fundamental tradeoff. thresh_max=1.5 and 2.0 successfully push wr_L32 into [0.20, 0.60],
but at the cost of accuracy collapsing from ~0.26 to ~0.03 (near random). The high early
threshold blocks too many informative writes during the critical bootstrap phase, causing
the memory to remain empty and the retrieval to fail.

**The gate adds no measurable value at standard task density**: exp_46_4 confirmed that
thresh*=0.70 produces healthy wr at L=96 (≈0.20) but the accuracy gain of the gate over
EMA-alone is consistently ≤0.005 (range: −0.027 to +0.005 across seeds). The task density
(ρ=0.078, N=5 pairs, H=64) is too easy for the gate's write selectivity to confer genuine
benefits. This suggests the gate's value is density-conditional.

**Gate advantage does not scale monotonically with interference density**: exp_46_5
tested ρ ∈ {0.08, 0.12, 0.19, 0.31, 0.50, 0.75}. In 2/3 seeds, the advantage went
negative at ρ=0.12 or ρ=0.19, violating the monotone hypothesis. This is unexpected:
the gate should be most useful under the highest memory pressure, but the relationship
appears non-monotone in practice. The gate may be disrupting useful early writes at
intermediate densities before the memory pressure is high enough to require selectivity.

**Root problem: the EMA bootstrap at L=32 is still unsolved**: exp_46_6 confirmed the
persistent failure mode. The calibrated full system (EMA + split + gate, thresh*=0.70)
achieves wr_L32≈0.81 across all seeds — well above the [0.20, 0.70] target. This means
the EMA keeps ‖k−vp‖ large throughout the short sequence (since vp hasn't convergied),
so the gate fires almost universally regardless of thresh*. The Phase 10 calibration
effort did not solve the sequence-length-dependent write-rate problem.

### Phase 11 Direction

The threshold calibration approach is fundamentally limited. The core problem is that
EMA persistence (α=0.95) at short sequences (L=32) keeps ‖k−vp‖ ≈ ‖k‖, making the
relative-norm gate fire near-universally. A fixed scalar threshold cannot solve this.

Next investigation directions:
1. **Length-adaptive decay**: Replace fixed α=0.95 with α = f(L) or a per-position
   schedule, so the EMA converges faster at shorter sequences and reduces the bootstrap
   problem. The EMA itself (not the gate) may need to be the target of calibration.
2. **Learned gate threshold**: Train a lightweight MLP to predict the gate threshold
   conditioned on EMA state or sequence position, rather than using a fixed scalar.
3. **Hard capacity constraints**: Instead of a gate, try a "memory budget" mechanism
   that enforces a fixed number of writes per sequence (e.g., top-k by gate score),
   making the write-rate constraint hard rather than soft.
4. **Higher-density benchmarks**: The current task (ρ=0.078) may be too easy. Move to
   ρ≥0.30 as the primary test case where gate selectivity has non-trivial consequences
   for accuracy.

## Phase 11 — Length-Adaptive EMA Alpha (Category 47)
*2026-03-11 to 2026-03-12*

### Phase 11 Results Summary (27 runs, 3 experiments × 3 seeds)

| Exp    | Outcome         | Key finding |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 47_1   | SUPPORTED (2/3) | exp_scale α(L)=0.95^(96/L) resolves L=32 bootstrap: wr drops 0.97→0.58. Seeds 123 & 777 SUPPORTED; seed 42 INCONCLUSIVE (acc noise at L=96). |
| 47_2   | REFUTED (3/3)   | Full split model OR gate structurally raises wr: wr_L32=0.774, wr_L96=0.653 (deterministic across all seeds, need ≤0.70/0.50). Accuracy preserved. |
| 47_3   | INCONCLUSIVE    | L=16 always wr=1.0 (5 pairs in 16 slots = every position novel). L=32–128 write rates healthy. Calibration table recorded. |

### Key Learnings

**The EMA bootstrap blocker at L=32 is resolved for the simple gate model.** exp_47_1
confirmed that α(L) = 0.95^(96/L) (exp_scale) keeps τ/L ≈ 0.21 constant across sequence
lengths, ensuring the EMA converges in a fixed fraction of each sequence. With α=0.857 at
L=32, the Write rate drops from 0.967 (fixed α=0.95) to 0.580 across all seeds —
consistently within the [0.20, 0.70] target. The hypothesis is supported on 2/3 seeds
(seed 42 showed acc ratio at L=96 just below threshold due to stochastic noise at ~26%
absolute accuracy; the write rate effect itself was clean on all 3 seeds).

**OR gate in split model raises write rate structurally.** exp_47_2 found that the full
architecture (episodic/semantic split + OR gate) consistently yields wr_L32=0.774 and
wr_L96=0.653 at thresh=0.40 with exp_scale — identical across all 3 seeds. This is not a
noise artifact. With two branches each firing at p≈0.58, the OR gate fires at
1−(1−p)²≈0.82, and partial correlation pulls it down slightly to 0.774. Accuracy
ratios are ≥0.970 in 2/3 seeds at L=32; L=96 is noisy. The fix is to raise thresh for
the split model. Geometric analysis suggests thresh ≈ 0.60–0.65 should push wr_L32 into
target range.

**L=16 is a structural wr=1.0 regime, not a failure.** exp_47_3 confirmed that at L=16,
both exp_scale (α=0.735) and linear_c5 (α=0.75) produce wr=1.0 across all seeds. With
5 key-value pairs in a 16-token sequence, ~77% of positions carry novel key-value content,
so the gate fires correctly at every position. Accuracy ratios at L=16 are ~1.0 (the
gate is not hurting accuracy). This is correct model behavior, not a failure mode. The
practical deployment minimum for meaningful gate selectivity is L≥24 (or L≥32 at
standard task density ρ=0.078).

**Calibration table from exp_47_3** (exp_scale formula):
| L   | α      | τ    | τ/L  |
|-----|--------|------|------|
| 16  | 0.7351 |  3.8 | 0.24 |
| 32  | 0.8574 |  7.0 | 0.22 |
| 48  | 0.9025 | 10.3 | 0.21 |
| 64  | 0.9259 | 13.5 | 0.21 |
| 96  | 0.9500 | 20.0 | 0.21 |
| 128 | 0.9623 | 26.5 | 0.21 |

τ/L is near-constant (0.21–0.22) for L≥32, confirming the formula design principle.

**linear_c5 (α = clamp(1−5/L, 0.75, 0.98)) is a simpler drop-in alternative.**
Both exp_47_1 and exp_47_3 show linear_c5 meets all criteria at L≥32 with the same
write-rate pattern as exp_scale. τ/L is exactly 0.20 (constant by construction for
L≥25). Either formula is acceptable; exp_scale is the primary choice due to cleaner
theoretical motivation.

### Phase 12 Direction

The remaining work to reach a deployable full architecture:

1. **Recalibrate threshold for OR-gate split model** (Priority 1): Run a threshold sweep
   at thresh ∈ {0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70} for the full system (FullAdaptiveModel
   with exp_scale). Target: wr_L32 ∈ [0.20, 0.70] and wr_L96 ∈ [0.15, 0.50]. Estimated
   optimal thresh ≈ 0.60–0.65. This is 10 training runs per seed, 3 seeds = 30 runs.

2. **Accept L<24 as fully-active regime**: The gate should be unconditionally enabled for
   L≥24; for L<24, wr≈1.0 is valid behavior. Implementation can include a floor check:
   if L < 24, skip gate computation (wr=1.0 by default).

3. **Proceed to implementation once thresh* found for full system**: After exp_48_1
   confirms a usable thresh* for the full OR-gate split model, all blockers are resolved
   and Step 1 of the implementation plan can begin.
